# Tic Tac Toe Game
Free Code Camp Advanced Project - Tic Tac Toe Game

## Objective
Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/KzXQgy/.
* I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
* My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
* I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

## Discussion

I started with designing the basic look of the board for desktops, adding a chalkboard background (using radial gradients) and then implementing the javascript to mark an "X" or "O" the board and store the value in an array. The board can also be cleared and game reset.

To do:
* calculate when the game ends (winner or draw)
* start a new game automatically after a game ends
* implement scoring
* implement two player feature
* implement computer player logic
